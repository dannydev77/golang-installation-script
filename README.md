# golang-installation-script
This is simple bash script that can be used to install the latest version of Golang and add to the environment variable and once finished notify the user installation completed and can now start writing code in GO.
## The code is still in testing phase.

## Installation 
Clone the repository.

To make the script executable, you can use the chmod command:
`chmod +x /path/to/golang-install.sh`

You can then run the script by typing ./golang-install.sh in the terminal.
`./golang-install.sh`

Hope this helps!!!
